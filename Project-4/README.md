This is the source code directory, for solutions to Project 4 described at https://anderkve.github.io/FYS3150/book/projects/project4.html

We have chosen a structure where we create one subfolder for each of the 9 problems, as they are separated in that description.
Under each folder Problem-? (for which coding is relevant) you find separate README.md files, explaining how to compile and run the executables related to that sub problem. 

Under directory /src you find source code files that are common to multiple problems. (Think of it as a function library collection)
Under directory /include is header-files with declarations of functions in files under /src.
