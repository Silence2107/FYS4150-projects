# Problem 9 manual
Run simulations for different number of slits, and plot probabilities for detecting at screen, in 1D form.

# Usage
Small programs for unit testing thereof. 
- Compile the code with 
	`g++ problem9.cpp -o problem9.exe ../src/* -I../include/ -std=c++17 -larmadillo`
- Run the code with 
	`./problem9.exe`
	`python3 ./plot_prob_of_y.py --file screen.csv`
Then look at generated .pdf files.
