This is the source code directory, for solutions to Project 5 described at https://anderkve.github.io/FYS3150/book/projects/project5.html

We have chosen to structure the project to contain a sub folder for each separate programming task. Under each folder Problem-X you find a separate README.md file, explaining how to compile and run the executables related to that sub problem.

You can find custom libraries under include/ and src/ folders.
