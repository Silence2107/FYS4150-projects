# Problem 5 manual

## Formulation

- Now letâ€™s look at how many similarity transformations we need before we reach a result where all non-diagonal matrix elements are close to zero.

## Implementation

- The function is implemented in p2-5.cpp but the bulf of functionality is reused from functions implemented in previous problems. 
    - Compile with `g++ p2-5.cpp ../src/*.cpp -o problem5 -larmadillo -I../include`
    - Run with `./problem5 <size N of A> <eps> <max iterations>`

To use the output you need to copy it from the terminal. 
Example output:
Converged=1 after 6246 iterations
Here 1 is indicating that it actually converged. If Converged=0 try increasing <max iterations> parameter and run again.
