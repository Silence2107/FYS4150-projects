# Problem 4 manual

The program implements the Jacobi rotation algorithm for solving the Av=lv eigenvalue problem, where A is a NxN (N=6) matrix of randomly generated values. 

The executable is generaed running the following command: 

`g++ -std=c++11 -larmadillo p2-4.cpp ../src/*.cpp  -o p2-4 -I../include/*.h `

which will produce the executable: 

`./p2-4`
